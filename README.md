Hi! This is a simple project that I follow from @DevEd

Watch the site live on https://6306745bf50cf719e1f985f8--lovely-otter-26ee8f.netlify.app/

What does it do? This site lets you add, edit, and delete todo lists that you could use to remind yourself for your tasks for the day.
It still needs some upgrades and modifications which I will update in a short time.

There are a few modifications from DevEd's code itself
I made a simpler one without the select and I added an edit button to update the Todo.

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project of a Todo List.
